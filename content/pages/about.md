Hi!!! I'm Kevin Mart√≠nez. I'm a Javascript developer at [DCSL GuideSmiths](https://www.dcsl.com/) and Cypress ambassador with several years of experience in web development and teaching in different academies focused in software development.

I've created this Blog to share my knowledge in testing, cypress, Javascript, and everything related to web technologies. I'll try to upload as many posts as I can, and they are going to be focused on problems that I find every day, tips, and mainly on how to test Frontend and Backend code created with Javascript technologies.

You can find more info about me and my work in these links.
